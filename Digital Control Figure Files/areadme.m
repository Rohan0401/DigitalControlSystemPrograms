% This is a toolbox to generate the figures in "Digital Control of Dynamic Systems", Franklin, Powell, 
% Workman, 3rd edition, 1998.  The .m files have been developed using Matlab v4.2 with the Control 
% System Toolbox, v3 and have been modified where required so that they execute correctly with Matlab

%  Created by Franklin and Powell, March 9, 1998, modify as you wish for your own use.
